# Requirements

Having a bold and optimistic vision of what was asked of us to develop, we needed to gather all essential requirements as soon as possible, since although we adopted an agile development process, big changes would delay our final deployment. Discussing between the team and with help from our supervisors, we managed to gather the necessary functionalities without whom our system would not work as expected.

## Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The system should be able to authenticate users upon login
- **FR2**: The system should allow an administrator to register new users
- **FR3**: The system should be able to automatically detect weapons in several video vigilance videos originated from cameras
- **FR4**: The system should mark people using weapons as suspects
- **FR5**: The system should be able to follow suspects along several cameras
- **FR6**: The system should be able to keep track (log) suspects movement along cameras
- **FR7**: The system should allow a user to choose a person in a video frame to mark as suspect
- **FR8**: The system should cut and save any video vigilance where a suspect appears
- **FR9**: The system should allow to register a camera
- **FR10**: The system should allow to unregister a camera
- **FR11**: The system should allow a user to upload a video from a certain timestamp to a camera
- **FR12**: The system should register and save any pointable characteristics from suspects
- **FR13**: The system should allow to download all video vigilance where a suspect appears
- **FR14**: The system should give alert messages when it identifies a suspect
- **FR15**: The system should allow a user to retrieve all logs 
- **FR16**: The system should highlight both identified suspects and weapons
- **FR17**: The system should print the suspects movement onto a map after tracking it

## Non-functional requirements

- **NFR1**: The system should have optimized data processing for the best possible efficiency
- **NFR2**: The system should have a secure database for information privacy and security
- **NFR3**: The system should have a consistent database
- **NFR4**: The system should delete old and irrelevant data to free up necessary memory
- **NFR5**: The system should save video cuts in a separate and safe file directory
- **NFR6**: The system should be compatible with the expected video files type
- **NFR7**: The system should be compatible with the expected cameras
