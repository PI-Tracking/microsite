# Project Description

## Overview

The identification/classification and tracking of people who have been deployed
due to certain characteristics, for example, because they are in possession of a weapon, it is a
technological and academic challenge. Just as real-time application can bring
advantages for various applications, within the scope of security, crowd monitoring,
analyzing behavior in closed environments or tracking people in
video surveillance systems.

- **Complete Overview**: [Tracking](../../static/documents/04%20Tracking.pdf)

## Key Features

- Apply segmentation techniques to outline the person and the transported object.
- Extract characteristics of people/objects that allow to identify them in different images.
- Integrate a tracker of people/objects, keeping it in the different frames collected by a camera.
- Implement a re-identification system that allows to re-identify people that moved from one camera to another.
- Trace a person's movement into a map.
- Evaluate the system's performance using metrics like IDF1, mAP and IoU.
