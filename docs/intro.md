# Introduction

## PI - Tracking Documentation

This microsite contains all the internal documentation related to the "Tracking" project, developed in the [Informatics Project](https://www.ua.pt/pt/uc/12276) course of [Universidade de Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/)

## Abstract

The main goal of this project is to identify and track criminals in a CCTV system, potentially aiding in the criminal investigation process. To accomplish this, we use a ML-trained model to detect weapons and identify characteristics of the people carrying them, in order to re-identify them if they move to another camera. With that, thousands of hours of CCTV videos from multiple cameras could be analysed quicker, helping an investigation team to rapidly locate and track suspects.
